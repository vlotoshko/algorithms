## Implementations of the variety algorithms and data structures, to feel and test how they work.

### Usage.
Usage: algorithm X Y Z
Where:
  X - number of the algorithm
  Y - repeat count, algorithm will be invoked Y times, doubling its element count each time
  Z - initial elements count
Sort algorithms:
  0:	Dummy sort
  1:	Buble sort
  2:	Comb sort
  3:	Shake sort
  4:	Quick sort
  5:	Quick sort median
